# weather-dashboard
Are you ever on the move and need to know the weather in multiple locations. Well you’re in the right spot.  With the weather dashboard you will be able to look up the weather in in city. Just end the cities name that you will be visiting and you’ll be off to either enjoying the weather or finding some cover to get out of it.  This was my first attempt and implementing APIs.  This utilizes the Openwether api and pieces out just info that’s important to you. I was able to use the fetch method by mean of jquerys Ajax. This was also my first time dealing with a UNIX time stamp and learned how to convert that to a usable format using moment.js. Hope you enjoy.

## Screen Shot

This is where i started with the fetch and after got working i switched to the ajax to familiarize myself with both. This is also where i became more comfortable with passing a variable from one function to another so that you can use it globaly.
